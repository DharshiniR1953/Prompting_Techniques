# 🧠 Prompting Techniques & Smart Examples

Prompting is the art of communicating effectively with AI to get the best results. Here are some key techniques with smart, real-world examples:


## 1️⃣ Zero-Shot Prompting

🔹 Ask AI to complete a task without giving any prior examples.

**💡 Example:**

Explain the importance of cybersecurity in one paragraph.

**🛠 AI Output:**

"Cybersecurity is essential to protect sensitive data from unauthorized access, ensuring privacy, financial security, and preventing cyber attacks such as phishing and malware infections."


## 2️⃣ One-Shot Prompting

🔹 Provide one example before asking AI to generate similar results.

**💡 Example:**

Translate this English sentence to French:  
"I love programming." → "J'adore la programmation."  
Now translate: "Artificial Intelligence is fascinating."

**🛠 AI Output:**

"L'Intelligence Artificielle est fascinante."

## 3️⃣ Few-Shot Prompting

🔹 Give multiple examples to guide AI for better accuracy.

**💡 Example:**

Convert these numbers to Roman numerals:  
1 → I  
5 → V  
10 → X  
Now convert: 50

**🛠 AI Output:**

"50 → L"

## 4️⃣ Chain-of-Thought (CoT) Prompting

🔹 Encourage AI to think step by step for complex reasoning.

**💡 Example:**

A store sells apples for $2 each. If you buy 3 apples and pay with $10, how much change do you get?  
Think step by step.

**🛠 AI Output:**

"3 apples × $2 = $6"
"You paid $10."
"Change = $10 - $6 = $4"
✅ Final Answer: $4

## 5️⃣ Role-Based Prompting

🔹 Instruct AI to respond from a specific perspective.

**💡 Example:**

You are a fitness coach. Explain why hydration is important after exercise.

**🛠 AI Output:**

"As a fitness coach, I recommend staying hydrated after workouts to replace lost fluids, prevent muscle cramps, and aid recovery."

## 6️⃣ Delimiter-Based Prompting

🔹 Use special markers (""", ###, etc.) to define input clearly.

**💡 Example:**

Summarize the following passage:  
"""  
Artificial Intelligence is revolutionizing industries by automating tasks, improving efficiency, and enabling data-driven decision-making.  
"""

**🛠 AI Output:**

"AI enhances industries through automation, efficiency, and data-driven decisions."

## 7️⃣ Self-Consistency Prompting

🔹 Ask AI to generate multiple answers and choose the best one.

**💡 Example:**

Give three possible answers for:  
What are some benefits of regular exercise?

**🛠 AI Output:**

Improves heart health 🏃
Boosts mental well-being 🧠
Enhances energy levels ⚡
✅ Final Answer: Regular exercise benefits heart health, mental well-being, and energy levels.

## 8️⃣ Interactive Prompting (Refinement)

🔹 Refine AI’s response by iterating over prompts.

**💡 Example:**

AI: "Exercise is good for health."  
User: "Can you make it more detailed?"  
AI: "Regular exercise improves cardiovascular health, strengthens muscles, and boosts mental well-being."
